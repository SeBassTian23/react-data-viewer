# Spreadsheet

The spreadsheet can be used to view and search your imported data. It also helps to copy small subsets of data or check if the data-type of a column is miss-identified. When importing data, the spreadsheet with data is shown after a successful import.

## Viewing Data

The spreadsheet also represents the data selections in your analysis. When data sub-sets are aselected, a new column called `Data Sub-Set` is added, with the name and color reflecting each set.

**Note** that the same entry can appear multiple times, if the selection data is filtered in that way.

Also thresholds are applied, reducing the number of entries according to those settings.

## Saving Data

Data from the spreadsheet can be saved in different formats.

+ `CSV` - Comma separated format
+ `TXT` - Tab separated format
+ `XLSX` - Excel spreadsheet file
+ `JSON` - JSON format (allows for better compatibility with arrays, objects, etc.)
