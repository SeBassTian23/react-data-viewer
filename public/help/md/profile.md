# Profile

The application provides the option to add a simple user profile that is stored locally and not shared with any service. When a new analysis is created the profile gets saved together with it as well as with every bookmark.

## Creating a Profile

The user profile is very basic, consisting of a name, email, and avatar, none of which are required. To open the profile dialog, select the <i class="bi bi bi-person-circle"></i> button from the side bar. If you created a profile with an avatar already, it will be replaced by your avatar.

1. Activate your profile, by selecting *Remember Me* to allow the app to set a cookie
1. Now you can provide name and email
1. To add an avatar, first add your email. You require an avatar stored with <https://gravatar.com> at this point.
1. Activate *Avatar* then and if your profile exists, your avatar will show up and be saved along with your profile.
1. Start a *New Analysis* to attach the profile to your analysis

The avatar can be removed from the profile by deactivating Avatar at any point. It can be updated, by deactivating and reactivating the avatar selector. The same is true in case the email changes.

## Creator

When a new analysis is started the local user profile is saved with the analysis. As of now, the creator cannot be removed from the analysis after it was started.

## Team

When creating a bookmark and a local user profile exists, it gets saved along with the bookmark. If multiple users work on an analysis and save bookmarks (and all have profiles), the analysis dialog will show a team listing every user who shared a profile.
