# Analysis

An analysis is the summary of your data, dashboard panels, bookmarks, and views and is automatically started once you start this web application.

## Analysis Information

Along with the data, dashboard panels, etc., the analysis dialog can be viewed, selecting the analysis <i class="bi bi-journal-richtext fs-5"></i> button from the Sidebar. You can give the analysis a name and add notes. The imported files, as well as the start and latest update of the analysis are automatically saved. Closing the dialog automatically updates the analysis.

## Managing an Analysis

### New Analysis

To start a new Analysis, "New Analysis..." can be selected from the drop down menu (shortcut <kbd><i class="bi bi-windows"></i> + Ctrl + N</kbd> <kbd>⌘ ^ N</kbd>). If needed, the web application can also be reloaded, confirming the reload dialog.

### Load Analysis

The saved analysis files are saved as zip files. Use "Load..." from the drop down menu (shortcut: <kbd>Ctrl + L</kbd> <kbd>⌘ L</kbd>) to select an analysis file.

_Please not that you cannot simply un-zip the analysis file, as the it doesn't contain regular files._

### Save Analysis

To save the current analysis use "Save..." from the drop down menu (shortcut: <kbd>Ctrl + S</kbd> <kbd>⌘ S</kbd>) to save the state of the analysis. Note that once the data is compiled, it is started as a download. Every time the analysis is saved, it is presented as a download, as the browser has no access to your drive. However, the analysis saves your file naming, so the existing file can be overwritten.
