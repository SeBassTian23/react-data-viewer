# Analysis

An analysis is the summary of your data, dashboard panels, bookmarks, and views and is automatically started once you start this web application.

## Analysis Information

Along with the data, dashboard panels, etc., the analysis dialog can be viewed, selecting the analysis <i class="bi bi-journal-richtext fs-5"></i> button from the Sidebar. You can give the analysis a name and add notes. The imported files, as well as the start and latest update of the analysis are automatically saved. Closing the dialog automatically updates the analysis.

## Managing an Analysis

### New Analysis

To start a new Analysis, "New Analysis..." can be selected from the drop down menu (shortcut <kbd><i class="bi bi-windows"></i> + Ctrl + N</kbd> <kbd>⌘ ^ N</kbd>). If needed, the web application can also be reloaded, confirming the reload dialog.

### Load Analysis

The saved analysis files are saved as zip files. Use "Load..." from the drop down menu (shortcut: <kbd>Ctrl + L</kbd> <kbd>⌘ L</kbd>) to select an analysis file.

_Please not that you cannot simply un-zip the analysis file, as the it doesn't contain regular files._

### Save Analysis

To save the current analysis use "Save..." from the drop down menu (shortcut: <kbd>Ctrl + S</kbd> <kbd>⌘ S</kbd>) to save the state of the analysis. Note that once the data is compiled, it is started as a download. Every time the analysis is saved, it is presented as a download, as the browser has no access to your drive. However, the analysis saves your file naming, so the existing file can be overwritten.

### Recent

When loading an analysis from a file on your local machine, or you start a new one, the analysis is saved by the browser locally. Navigate to a list of analyses selecting "Recent..." from the menu and select the analysis you would like to see or continue working on. Loading the analysis, the start dialog will also show the last 3 analyses worked on.

The available space for saving analyses is limited by the browser used, so make sure to also save (download) your analysis to prevent data loss.

_Modern browsers allow to write and read data from a secure location on your computer ([Origin Private File System](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API/Origin_private_file_system))._
