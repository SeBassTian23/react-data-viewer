# Parameters

The *parameters* or available columns from the data import are available (activated) by default and can be de-activated or re-activated as needed at any time. 

Deactivated parameters are no longer showing up as columns in the spreadsheet or in any of the selection menus.

## Filters

If the parameter is a filter to filter the data into sub-sets of data it will not show up in the list of filters. This is not impacting previous results.

## Thresholds

Parameters defined as thresholds and being deactivated are not impacted. Existing thresholds are still listed and applied.
