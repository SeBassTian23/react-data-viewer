# React Data Viewer

> Explore your data sets

## Features

This data viewer allows you to import data from text, CSV, and JSON files for analysis. This includes filtering data, setting thresholds, defining data types, as well as plotting data, performing statistical tests, and adding data to maps when geocoordinates are available.

The analysis can be saved, including the original data, and shared for collaboration with others.

Results can be added to a dashboard, which is updated when data is filtered or thresholded or the selection of subsets is changed.

## Privacy

The web application is not storing any data or requiring communication with a server. A cookie will be saved if a user profile is activated with an optional avatar from <https://gravatar.com>. Map tiles are received from different sources as indicated on the map.
